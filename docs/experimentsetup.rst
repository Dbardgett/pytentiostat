Experiment Setup
=================

A variety of cells can be characterized using a potentiostat. This section will briefly describe cell preparation and
attachment to the potentiostat. In most cases, there will either be two electrodes of 3 electrodes. In a two electrode cell
the voltage is dependent on changes that occur on both electrodes. Conversely, in a three electrode cell, the potentiall
is measure against a constant reference. Therefore, any change in potential is ascribed to changes that occur on the
working electrode.

Two-electrode experiment
------------------------

Examples:

* Resistor
* Battery
* Solar cell
* Fuel cell

In each of these applications, the device only has two electrical leads. However, the potentiostat has three clips.
To connect the potentiostat to one of these cells, attach the reference electrode clip from the potentiostat to the
counter electrode clip. Now there should be a working electrode clip and a counter/reference clip to attach to the two
leads on the electrochemical cell.

Three-electrode experiment
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Materials and Instrumentation

#. JUAMI Potentiostat
#. USB adapter
#. Glassware for electrochemical cell (could be three-neck flask, beaker, etc.)
#. Working electrode
#. Counter electrode
#. Reference electrode
#. Electrolyte

.. note::

   To run a two-electrode cell, there will only be a working electrode and a counter electrode. In this case, the user
   can simply attach the reference clip to the counter clip from the potentiostat and clip these to the counter electrode.
