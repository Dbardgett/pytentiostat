Use Case: Running Chronoamperometry for a Two or Three Electrode Cell on the JUAMI Potentiostat 

Intended User: Undergraduate (UG) Researcher at a University in Africa with Introductory Knowledge of Electrochemistry and Chronoamperometry. The instructions in this UC assume that the student already has a two or three electrode cell set up and ready for testing (working electrode, counter electrode, and (optional) reference electrode are all in proper locations and connected to the potentiostat clips). 

Program Setup:

UG selects to run a chronoamperometry experiment

UG defines a file name that will be used to export the voltage, current, and time information

UG inputs potential to apply (V vs. open circuit voltage (Eocv))

UG inputs length of time to wait before applying potential

UG inputs length of time to apply potential

UG inputs current window (the program will automatically turn off if current exceeds this range)

UG starts the program

The program starts the chronoamperometry experiment

The program displays a plot of Current versus Time

The program starts recording current across cell and time since start of program

The program applies the user-defined potential after waiting for user-defined amount of time for user-defined amount of time

The program stores the applied potential and measured current at each time step into file with user-defined filename

The program stops applying a potential

The program stops measuring current and time since start of program

The program issues a prompt that experminet is complete
